# Image-classifier-using-cnn

- This is my first project of Neural-Networks.
- In this I also used concept of Convolution2D layer and Maxpooling Layer to increase accuracy of my model.


## Directory/file  : Work

- static : hold 'css' and 'javascripts' files
- templates : hold 'HTML' and 'image' files
- upload : images uploaded from clients but it will automatically  deleted to avoid storage issues
- app.py : flask file to start server
- CNN.ipynb : Implementaion file of CNN model
- model_best.h5 : model with 85% + Accuracy (Pre-trained)
- requirement.txt : External library name & versions


## Requirements

- First run following command to download external library
- python3 -m pip install -r requirement.txt
- After completed go to Run part.


## How to start Flask-Server

- Go to project directory then run following command
- python3 app.py
- go to link given in terminal during starting kernel
